This is a simple proof-of-concept project for learning React, Redux and Node.js in a limited timeframe.

## Status

A simple, non-persisted WebSocket-based chat. Has no sessions, no channels, just one page showing the messages. Also practically no tests, no error handling.

## Next steps

* Implement channels/chatrooms
* Implement user sessions (so as not to lose chat history upon reload at the very least)
* 

Thunks look nice and I would have wanted to work with Promises. Alas, I have so far only implemented the simplest WebSocket-based chat with no real async requests flying around.
